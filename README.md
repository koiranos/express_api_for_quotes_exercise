# Quotes API (Express)

This repository holds my solution for the codecademy project "Quote API".
It is a presentation project for implementing the basic CRUD operations in a project.

## Objecive

I was asked to build a small JSON API, to serve up famous quotes about computers, technology, and programming.
The data (quotes) were given as an array of objects:

```sh
const quotes = [
  {
    quote: 'We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins.',
    person: 'Ellen Ullman'
  }
]
```

## Requirements

There are eight steps in total to complete the project. Seven of them are required.

  - Express Routes and Express Routers lessons have to be completed in order to take this project.
  - As you built the app you can use the front end to interact with the operations or Postman tool.
  - Set your server to listen on the PORT.
  - Your API should have a GET /api/quotes/random route. It should send back a random quote from the data
  - Your API should have a GET /api/quotes route. It should return all quotes from the data.
  - Your API should have a POST /api/quotes route for adding new quotes to the data.
  - Finished. Great work!.
  
  Extra Step
  - Add a PUT route for updating quotes in the data.
  - Add a DELETE route for deleting quotes from the data array.
  
## Conclution

I am happy that I was able to complete this porject as I am learning how Express works. 
It helped me to clarify few consepts regarding REST APIs and CRUD operations that I could not understand.
It was fun and I believe that anyone learning Express or other frameworks should try similar projects.
Experience comes with coding.

If you want to check my solution run the code below inside project folder


```sh
npm install
node express.js
```
Then you can go to ```sh http://localhost:4001/ ``` to interactwith the app
